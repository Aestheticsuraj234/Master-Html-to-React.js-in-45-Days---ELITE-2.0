## 1. Introduction to Web Development

### What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of building, creating, and maintaining websites. It involves:
- **Web design** (structure, appearance, layout).
- **Web programming** (functionality and user interaction).
- **Database management** (storing, retrieving data).

Web development includes **front-end development** (client-side) and **back-end development** (server-side), both of which work together to build functional and visually appealing websites.

## 2. Front-end vs. Back-end Development

### Front-end Development (Client-Side)
Front-end development is everything that users see and interact with in their browsers. It involves designing the look and feel of a website and ensuring itâ€™s responsive.

Technologies:
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Styling the appearance of web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

**Example: Basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript code**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Web Development Example</title>
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #f4f4f4; }
        h1 { color: #333; }
        button { padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #007bff; color: white; border: none; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Web Development</h1>
    <button onclick="greet()">Click Me</button>

    <script>
        function greet() {
            alert("Hello, welcome to the world of Web Development!");
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

### Back-end Development (Server-Side)
Back-end development is focused on managing the server, database, and application logic. It ensures that the front-end has the right data and processes user input.

Technologies:
- **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime for backend)
- **Express.js** (web framework)
- **Database**: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

## 3. Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the basic structure of the website.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style and layout web pages. It controls the design, including color, font, spacing, and layout.

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  color: #333;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.6;
  color: #555;
}
```

### JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web features like dynamic content, animations, and handling user input.

```javascript
function showMessage() {
  alert('Hello, World!');
}
```

**Visual: How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together**

- **HTML** provides the basic structure.
- **CSS** makes it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript** adds interactivity and dynamic content.

## 4. Web Development Tools and Code Editors

To effectively write and organize code, developers use various tools and code editors. Some popular tools include:

### 1. **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**
- A lightweight yet powerful code editor with features like IntelliSense, debugging, Git integration, and extensions for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.

### 2. **Google Chrome Developer Tools**
- Chrome provides built-in developer tools for debugging, inspecting elements, and analyzing web performance.

### 3. **Git & GitHub**
- **Git**: Version control system to track changes in code.
- **GitHub**: Platform for hosting repositories and collaborating with others.

**Example: Installing VSCode**

1. Go to the official VSCode website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Download and install the editor.
3. Add extensions like HTML/CSS Support, JavaScript Debugger, and Prettier.

**Visual: VSCode UI**

- Editor window where code is written.
- File explorer to manage project files.
- Extensions for added functionality.
